# rock_papper_scissors

This is a JavaScript program used to help teach me to problem solve.  Figuring out how to go from a blank slate to having a functional console program that lets a user play rock paper scissors against a computer.

Further into the Odin Project a GUI will be added so that this can be played in the DOM.
